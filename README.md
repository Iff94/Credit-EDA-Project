Problem Statement

Introduction:
This project focuses on the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) within a practical business context. The project focuses on utilizing EDA techniques to gain insight into risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector. 

Business Understanding:
Loan providers often face challenges in assessing loan applications, especially when applicants have limited or no credit history. This situation creates opportunities for individuals to exploit the system by defaulting on loans. Imagine working for a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers. The goal is to employ EDA to analyze data patterns, ensuring that deserving loan applicants are not rejected.

When evaluating loan applications, the company must consider two types of risks:

1. Loss of Business: Rejecting a loan application from a potentially creditworthy applicant results in missed business opportunities.
Financial Loss: Approving a loan for an applicant likely to default leads to financial losses.
The dataset provided includes information on loan applications, categorized into two scenarios:

2. Clients with payment difficulties, characterized by late payments exceeding a specified threshold on initial loan installments.
All other cases where payments are made on time.
Decision outcomes for loan applications include:

Approved
Cancelled
Refused
Unused offer

Business Objectives:
This project aims to identify predictive patterns indicating clients' difficulties in repaying installments. These insights can inform strategic actions such as adjusting loan terms, imposing higher interest rates on risky applicants, or denying loans altogether. The ultimate goal is to ensure deserving loan applicants are not overlooked based on erroneous risk assessments. Through EDA, the study seeks to pinpoint significant variables influencing loan default, enabling the company to refine its risk assessment strategies.

Recommendation:
To enhance comprehension of the domain, conduct independent research on risk analytics, particularly focusing on variable types and their implications. The dataset comprises three files: 'application_data.csv' containing client information at the time of application, 'previous_application.csv' detailing previous loan data, and 'columns_description.csv' serving as a data dictionary explaining variable meanings.
